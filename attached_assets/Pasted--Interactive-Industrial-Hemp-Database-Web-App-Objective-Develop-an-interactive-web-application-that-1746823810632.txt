 Interactive Industrial Hemp Database Web App
Objective: Develop an interactive web application that serves as a comprehensive database for industrial hemp uses and products. The application should allow users to explore uses/products by navigating through categories based on hemp plant type, plant part, industry, and sub-industry. The app should also provide detailed information for each use/product and an estimated total count of applications.

Key Features & Structure:

Homepage:

Display high-quality images of the two primary types of hemp plants (e.g., one grown primarily for fiber/stalk and another for grain/seed, or as defined in the provided documents).
Make each plant image clickable. Clicking a plant image should navigate the user to a page displaying the parts of that specific hemp plant.
Plant Part Page:

Visually represent the selected hemp plant broken down into its usable parts (e.g., stalk, leaves, flowers, seeds, roots). This could be an interactive diagram or a series of images/icons.
Each plant part should be clickable.
Clicking a plant part should navigate the user to a page listing the uses/products derived from that part.
Uses/Products Listing Page:

Display the first 5 uses/products associated with the selected plant part.
Organize these uses/products clearly by:
Industry: (e.g., Textiles, Construction, Food & Beverage, Automotive, Paper, Bioplastics, Animal Care, Cosmetics & Personal Care, Energy, Agriculture, Environmental, Medical/Pharmaceuticals)    
Subcategories within each Industry: (e.g., Textiles -> Apparel, Home Furnishings; Construction -> Hempcrete, Insulation)    
Implement pagination or a "load more" feature to display further uses/products if more than 5 exist for the selected criteria.
Each listed use/product should be clickable to view its detailed page.
Use/Product Detail Page:

For each individual use/product, display the following information:
Name: Clear and concise name of the use/product.
Description: A detailed explanation of the use/product, its benefits, and applications.
Image(s): High-quality image(s) or visuals of the product or its application.
Miscellaneous Information & Facts: Include relevant data, interesting facts, historical context, sustainability aspects, or processing information (e.g., "Hemp fibers are known for their strength and durability", "Hemp seeds are a rich source of protein and essential fatty acids" ).   
Affiliate Links: A section to display affiliate links (with appropriate disclaimers) to online stores or platforms where the product or similar items can be purchased.
Categorization Logic & Data Structure (Guidance for Firebase):

Data Model: Design Firestore collections to efficiently store and query the hemp uses/products. Consider a hierarchical structure or linked collections.
hempPlantTypes (e.g., documents for "Fiber Hemp", "Seed/Grain Hemp")
Each hempPlantType document could contain a subcollection plantParts (e.g., "Stalk", "Seeds", "Leaves", "Flowers", "Roots").
Each plantPart document could contain a subcollection usesProducts.
Uses/Products Documents: Each document in the usesProducts subcollection should contain fields for:
name (String)
description (String)
imageUrl (String)
industry (String - e.g., "Textiles", "Construction")
subCategory (String - e.g., "Apparel", "Hempcrete")
miscInfo (Array of strings or a Map)
facts (Array of strings or a Map)
affiliateLinks (Array of Maps, each with linkName and url)
plantTypeRef (Reference to the parent hempPlantTypes document)
plantPartRef (Reference to the parent plantParts document)
useProductID (A unique numerical identifier for each use/product)
Querying: Implement queries that allow filtering uses/products based on plant type, plant part, industry, and subcategory.
Numbering and Estimation:

Assign a unique numerical ID to each distinct use/product entry in the database.
The application should dynamically calculate and display an "Estimated Total Number of Hemp Uses/Products" based on the total count of unique entries in the usesProducts collections across all plant types and parts. This number should be prominently displayed, perhaps on the homepage or in a dedicated "About" section.
User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):

The application should be visually appealing, intuitive, and easy to navigate.
Use clear typography and a consistent design language.
Ensure responsive design for usability across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Consider implementing a search functionality to allow users to directly search for uses, products, or industries.
Technological Considerations for Firebase Studio:

Hosting: Utilize Firebase Hosting for deploying the web app.
Database: Use Firestore as the NoSQL database to store the categorized hemp information.
Storage: Use Firebase Storage for hosting images of hemp plants, parts, and products.
Authentication (Optional): If admin features are needed to manage the database content, implement Firebase Authentication.
Cloud Functions (Optional): For more complex backend logic, such as calculating the total number of uses if it becomes computationally intensive on the client-side, or for managing affiliate link updates.
Development Steps Overview:

Data Structuring: Finalize the Firestore data model based on the categorization requirements.
Data Population: Gather and input the hemp use/product data into Firestore. This will be the most time-consuming part and accuracy is key. Leverage the provided documents ("Industrial Hemp Uses Comprehensive Report"  and "Hemp's Versatile Industrial Applications" ) for initial data.   
Homepage Development: Create the homepage with clickable plant type images.
Plant Part Page Development: Develop the page to display and handle clicks on plant parts.
Uses/Products Listing Page Development: Create the page to list uses/products with industry/subcategory filtering.
Use/Product Detail Page Development: Develop the template for displaying detailed information about each use/product.
Numbering/Estimation Logic: Implement the system for counting and displaying the total number of uses.
Styling and UX Refinement: Apply CSS and ensure the application is user-friendly.
Testing: Thoroughly test all functionalities and data accuracy.
Information to Extract from Provided Documents:

Types of Hemp Plants: Identify if the documents specify distinct types beyond the general "industrial hemp" (e.g., varieties optimized for fiber vs. seed).    
Plant Parts: List all mentioned parts of the hemp plant (e.g., stalk (bast fiber, hurd/shiv), seeds, leaves, flowers, roots).    
Industries & Subcategories: Compile a comprehensive list of industries and their respective subcategories that utilize hemp.    
Specific Uses/Products: For each plant part, list specific uses and products, noting their industry and subcategory.    
Facts and Miscellaneous Information: Extract interesting facts or details about specific uses or hemp properties.
