              <p>
                Industrial hemp, scientifically classified as a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant
                species, is distinguished primarily by its exceptionally low concentration of
                tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound predominantly associated
                with marijuana. Typically, this THC content does not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight
                basis, a crucial threshold that differentiates it both legally and practically from its
                psychoactive counterpart.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 2018 Farm Bill in the United States enshrined this THC
                limit into law, effectively legalizing hemp and removing it from the purview of the
                Controlled Substances Act. This legislative landmark has catalyzed widespread
                opportunities for hemp cultivation, processing, and commercialization, areas
                previously constrained by the plant's association with marijuana.

                The earliest tangible evidence points to hemp's use approximately 10,000 years ago. 
                Archaeological findings in ancient Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), dating back to around 8000 BCE, 
                reveal that villagers employed hemp cord in their pottery, signifying its early importance for fundamental technologies.

                During the Age of Exploration, in 1492, Christopher Columbus's ships, which famously

              The industrial hemp stalk is a versatile resource, yielding two primary types of fiber:
              the outer bast fibers and the inner hurd. Bast fibers, which constitute approximately
              14% of the plant's material, are long, strong, and prized for their use in textiles.
              Reaching lengths of up to 5 meters, these fibers are characterized by their
              durability, absorbency, and even antimicrobial properties. The inner woody core,
              known as hurd or shives, comprises shorter fibers that are lighter, dust-free, and
              highly absorbent, making them suitable for a wide array of other applications.
